Summary of the work Done

I have added a new component DHT-11 Sensor module. The task was to add a new component to the cloud platform.
First I had to understand how the particular module works. The Sensor module gives us two outputs temperature and humidity. 
So we need to sliders to get the two inputs. The already written slider class was used to create objects.

Three files were newly added: DHT11.ts, DHT11.json, DHT11.svg
